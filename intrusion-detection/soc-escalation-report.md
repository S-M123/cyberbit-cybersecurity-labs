## 🧪 Lab Title
Day in a SOC Analyst Life – Writing an Escalation Report

## 🎯 Objective
To simulate the role of a SOC analyst by analyzing security alerts,
determining incident severity, and producing a professional escalation
report for further investigation.

## 🖥️ Scenario Overview
A simulated enterprise environment generated multiple security alerts
requiring review and correlation. The objective was to assess the alerts,
identify potentially malicious activity, and determine whether escalation
to higher-tier analysts was required.

## 🔍 Analyst Actions
- Reviewed security alerts and supporting telemetry
- Correlated events across logs and monitoring dashboards
- Assessed potential impact, scope, and urgency
- Determined incident severity based on observed indicators
- Documented findings using standard SOC escalation practices

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- SIEM-based alert monitoring
- Log correlation and timeline analysis
- Incident severity classification
- Escalation documentation and reporting

## ⚠️ Key Findings
- Alerts indicated suspicious behavior requiring further investigation
- Indicators suggested potential security impact beyond normal activity
- Escalation was justified based on severity and risk assessment

## 📈 Escalation Decision
The incident met escalation criteria due to:
- Potential impact on systems or data
- Indicators of abnormal or unauthorized activity
- Need for deeper forensic or threat analysis

The case was escalated to **Tier 2 / Incident Response** for advanced analysis.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- SOC alert triage and analysis
- Incident prioritization
- Risk-based decision-making
- Clear and concise technical reporting

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Accurate escalation requires context, not just alert volume
- Clear documentation accelerates response and investigation
- Well-structured reports reduce analyst handoff errors
